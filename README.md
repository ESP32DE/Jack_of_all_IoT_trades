# What's up in late summer / autumn of 2017

`The Jack of all IoT trades` is up and coming!


## What's that 

``The Jack of all IoT trades`` is an open hardware project from and for the ESP32 community and comes step by step.

There is a try **_to build in_** many optional IoT / IoE things by adaption breakouts step by step on this board that this board becomes an education character for hobbyists, students, teachers and professional engineers.

It comes with arduino friendly form size and [Arduino core for the ESP32 support](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32) 

Also get support for [Espressif IoT Development Framework](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf) the official development framework for ESP32.

Visit this [repo](https://github.com/ESP32DE/Jack_of_all_IoT_trades) time to time cause it gets time to time an update here

### What has already been conceived to realize and what is already running  

- WiFi / BLE / BT Base is by **ESP32**
  - [Info ESP32](http://espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32/overview)

- Supplement follows


### To Do
- ~create repo~ 
- ~create readme~
- append readme text with more infos
- create time plan
- create base info from the board
- create base info from form size factor
- create list for optional IoT and IoE adaptation boards like sensoric, moto stepper ...
- calculate Boardprice and work
- create possible things like kickstarter or other to go in serie with the idea

powered by ***ESP32***
- ***ESP32*** _is highly-integrated with in-built antenna switches, RF balun, power amplifier, low-noise receive amplifier, filters, and power management modules. ESP32 adds priceless functionality and versatility to your applications with minimal Printed Circuit Board (PCB) area requirements._ and comes from [Espressif](http://espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32/overview) 


The name "***Jack of all IoT trades***" for the education board 
- this was [suggest](https://twitter.com/nikil511/status/868445425086418944) from `Manolis Nikiforakis` alias ``@nikil511``
