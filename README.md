## The Jack of all IoT trades

it is an open hardware project from and for the ESP32 community and comes step by step.

there is a try to build in many things optional by adaption breakouts step by step on this board that this board becomes an education character for for hobbyists, students, teachers and professional engineers.

It becomes arduino friendly form size and code support.
